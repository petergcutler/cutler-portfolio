    It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. If we're
    going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care
    of them. Happy painting, God bless. It's important to me that you're happy. You're
    meant to have fun in life.

    We'll play with clouds today. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here
    and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the
    river and drowned. Trees grow however makes them happy.

    Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Maybe he has a
    little friend that lives right over here. Nice little clouds playing around in
    the sky. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you
    may be right. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
    framework first.
