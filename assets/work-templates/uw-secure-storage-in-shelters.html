        We'll play with clouds today. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here
        and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the
        river and drowned. Trees grow however makes them happy. Nice little fluffy clouds
        laying around in the sky being lazy. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right
        over here. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. And I know you're saying,
        'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Everyone wants to enjoy
        the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.
