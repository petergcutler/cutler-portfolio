        Audience segmentation is at the heart of Crowdskout's data analytics
        system. In 2016, after the segmentation tool grew in complexity, we
        overhauled the interface to this critical tool to better support the
        new capabilities it offered.

      Crowdskout Profiles
    </h2>

    <p>
      Audience segments in Crowdskout are made up of deanonymized "profiles." A
      mock profile is shown below. Each profile is made up of hundreds of criteria,
      including demographic information as well as many other types of info.

    <p>
      Users build segments of profiles by selecting the criteria that they want to
      segment on, for instance, people of a certain gender, age, and/or ethnicity.
      Doing so, they can find all of the profiles in their database that match
      these criteria.
    </p>

    <p>
      By creating a segment, Crowdskout users can monitor these different segments
      of profiles, and take action to contact these individuals in different ways.

      The Crowdskout Segmenting Tool

    <p>
      We updated the segmenting tool to improve the way users create and manage
      their audience segments.

      Crowdskout's segmenting component is a complex, interactive module
      within the application. If you have any questions, I'm happy to walk through
      the design and code involved. Thanks for reading.
