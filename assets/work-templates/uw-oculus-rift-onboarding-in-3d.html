      We'll play with clouds today. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here
      and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the
      river and drowned. Trees grow however makes them happy. Nice little fluffy clouds
      laying around in the sky being lazy. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right
      over here. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. And I know you're saying,
      'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Everyone wants to enjoy
      the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.

    It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. If we're
    going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care
    of them. Happy painting, God bless. It's important to me that you're happy. You're
    meant to have fun in life.
