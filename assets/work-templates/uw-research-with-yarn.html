      <p>
        Over the course of six months from 2017-2018, I worked with a Directed
        Research Group in HCDE to help run a long-term evaluation of Yarn &mdash;
        a research iOS app for writing stories of accomplishment through personal
        data like running data, photos, videos, and text.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yarn uses a structured writing experience to help people create content
        which aligns with their goals for sharing that others would find
        interesting. Yarn was specifically designed to support two types of
        stories of personal accomplishment: training for a running race or
        working on Do-It-Yourself projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I helped to recruit, interview, and manage a cohort of 15 participants who
        used the app for four weeks each. Throughout the study, we conducted weekly
        surveys as well as pre- and post-study semi-structured interviews. At
        the end of the study, I helped to analyze and synthesize the data. Our
        findings are under submission to CHI Proceedings in 2018.

      Understanding the Research and the App
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the outset of our project, the design of the Yarn application was
      complete, but we had to organize and run its usability study. I joined
      a team with three other students to help run the study and analyze our
      findings.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="work-body-image-caption">
        Sharing DIY and running progress on Yarn
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We first spent some time familiarizing ourselves with the application. To
      contrast Yarn with an app like Runkeeper, Yarn focuses on building an
      extended narrative from many chapters, rather than on "individual" runs.
      Each run (e.g. 'Wednesday 5k') is added to an overall story (e.g. 'Training
      for the Boston Marathon'). The same would be true of a DIY project like
      building a chair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the text, images, and video that make up each chapter, Yarn
      presents a more holistic view of the overall project. This is foundational
      to the guiding question we were addressing: does this holistic approach to
      sharing improve the feedback that our participants get from their
      communities?
    </p>

    <p>
      After using the application for a week, and discussing the research with
      Daniel Epstein, the PhD candidate running the study, we began recruiting.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Research Planning
    </h2>

    <p>
      The research around Yarn was more involved than in many stand-alone
      usability tests. We were recruiting a cohort to use the application for over
      a month, and interviewing not just our cohort of participants, but also their
      social contacts to understand their network's perspectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating our research plan, we went through a number of important steps:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Crafting a flexible timeline to allow for drop-out participants,
        recruitment, four weeks of application use and check-ins, as well
        as final interviews and analysis
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating screening surveys to address general requirements, as well as
        specific criteria around DIY or running
      </li>
      <li>
        Preparing a comprehensive on-boarding for participants, including
        technical explanations and providing research background
      </li>
      <li>
        Recruiting across Seattle DIY and running communities
      </li>
      <li>
        Skype interviews with participants to on-board and explain our process
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Running the Study, Surveying, and Interviewing
    </h2>

    <p>
      After two weeks of recruitment, we reached our goal of organizing 15
      participants who would use the application and share progress with their
      friends or family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the course of the next 5 weeks, we met as a team and worked to
      accomplish some key tasks:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Discussing emerging findings based on our participants' patterns of use
      </li>
      <li>
        Crafting weekly surveys to explore participants' perceptions
      </li>
      <li>
        Discussing key interview criteria and progressively building a final
        interview script based on our participants' feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reaching out to participants who dropped-off, and replacing
        them if and when they decided to leave the study
      </li>
      <li>
        Conducting final interviews with our participants. Each team member
        interviewed about 5 participants for an hour to explore their feedback
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="work-body-h3">
      Focusing our Interviews around our Research Questions
    </h3>

    <p>
      One of our primary efforts during this time was discussing and honing our
      interview approach to direct participant discussions towards our research
      questions, and away from issues related to bugs or visual designs in the app.
      These issues proved to be distracting for some participants, and we mitigated
      them by:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Creating a space for participants to voice their feedback related
        to bugs or visual issues; listening intently and honestly to their concerns
      </li>
      <li>
        Candidly explaining that the application would not go to market, and that
        we were interested in understanding their feelings about sharing and feedback
      </li>
      <li>
        Connecting their experience on Yarn to commercial tools; if a feature showed
        errors on Yarn, how would they have responded to it instead on a more commercial
        app like Runkeeper?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The interviews proved to be rich with feedback towards our research questions,
      and we next began to analyze the interviews towards summarizing our findings.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Analyzing our Findings
    </h2>

    <p>
      During the period from March - June 2018, we'll be analyzing our findings.
      Check back soon for more information as we continue to update the
      publication under review.
