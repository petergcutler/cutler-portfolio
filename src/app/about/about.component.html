          Hey, I'm Peter Cutler, and I'm a UX designer and developer living in Seattle. In 2019, I completed my M.S. in <a target="_blank" class="basic-link" href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/ms/">
          Human Centered Design & Engineering</a> at the University of
          Washington.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've worked in different tech roles for the past seven years, doing
          things like UX, product management, and software engineering with some great people. <a class="basic-link" routerLink="/work"> You can find some of my work here</a>. Take a look and feel free to reach out.
