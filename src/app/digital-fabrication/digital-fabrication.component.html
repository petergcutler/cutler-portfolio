          Hey, I'm Peter Cutler, and I'm a UX designer and developer living in Seattle.
          I'm taking Digital Fabrication to learn some cool design methods.
          I'll probably use what we learn to make things for my home, but maybe for work too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I'm looking forward to learning Grasshopper. Some of my friends have been using
          it on interesting projects. I'm happy to teach my peers about design, coding,
          or whatever else! Ask me anything in the Mill. Once we have to use our website for something, I'll probably update this page.

      A1: Laser Cut

    <div class="assignment-body">
      <p>Over the last six days, I was out of town for a family vacation in Los Angeles. This prevented me from getting a lot of this assignment done (for now), but I was able to gather inspiration and do some sketching! We took trips to The Getty, LACMA, and The Broad museums, where I got to check out a lot of Bauhaus works from the early 20th century.</p>

      <div class="assignment-h2">Kandinsky</div>

      <p>I focused on some of Kandinsky's paintings, which are exploring the repetition of grids and lines. I wanted these to inform my repeating item, so that my 3d structure would look like a Kandinsky work in sculpture form.</p>

      <div class="assignment-h2">Sketching and Vector</div>

      <p>I explored some of the different shapes from Kandinsky's paintings within Illustrator. I didn't have time to get too far into this phase, but I was able to play with some interlocking circles, based on "Circles within Circles". Ideally I'd also include a series of lines/poles to flesh this out even further.</p>

      <app-image-viewer
        path="../assets/images/digital-fabrication/a1/three-slot-circle.png"
        description="Multiple small slots - probably a bad idea"
        class="assignment-image">
      </app-image-viewer>

      <p>I predicted I wouldn't maintain stability in my model while including multiple slots along the X/Y axis of the circle, so shifted to a model with two, longer slots in a cross shape. This might let the circles interlock more effectively.</p>
