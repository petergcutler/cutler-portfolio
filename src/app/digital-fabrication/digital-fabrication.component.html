          Hey, I'm Peter Cutler, and I'm a UX designer and developer living in Seattle.
          I'm taking Digital Fabrication to learn some cool design methods.
          I'll probably use what we learn to make things for my home, but maybe for work too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I'm looking forward to learning Grasshopper. Some of my friends have been using
          it on interesting projects. I'm happy to teach my peers about design, coding,
          or whatever else! Ask me anything in the Mill. Once we have to use our website for something, I'll probably update this page.

      <div class="assignment-body" *ngIf="selectedAssignment.id === 1">
        <p>Over the last six days, I was out of town for a family vacation in Los Angeles. This prevented me from getting a lot of this assignment done (for now), but I was able to gather inspiration and do some sketching! We took trips to The Getty, LACMA, and The Broad museums, where I got to check out a lot of Bauhaus works from the early 20th century.</p>

        <div class="assignment-h2">Kandinsky</div>

        <p>I focused on some of Kandinsky's paintings, which are exploring the repetition of grids and lines. I wanted these to inform my repeating item, so that my 3d structure would look like a Kandinsky work in sculpture form.</p>

        <div class="assignment-h2">Sketching and Vector</div>

        <p>I explored some of the different shapes from Kandinsky's paintings within Illustrator. I didn't have time to get too far into this phase, but I was able to play with some interlocking circles, based on "Circles within Circles". Ideally I'd also include a series of lines/poles to flesh this out even further.</p>

          class="assignment-image">
        </app-image-viewer>

        <p>I predicted I wouldn't maintain stability in my model while including multiple slots along the X/Y axis of the circle, so shifted to a model with two, longer slots in a cross shape. This might let the circles interlock more effectively.</p>

      <!-- Assignment 2 -->
      <div class="assignment-body" *ngIf="selectedAssignment.id === 2">
        <p>I continued where I left off with assignment 1, taking Kandinsky's "Circles in a Circle" as a model, and using it as a basis for a 3d/sculptural version.</p>

        <app-image-viewer
          path="../assets/images/digital-fabrication/a1/kandinsky-circles-in-a-circle.jpg"

        <div class="assignment-h2">Sketching in Figma</div>

        <p>I first explored what it would mean to make this in 3d in Figma. Through the embedded link, you can see what I found and look at my process.</p>

        <iframe
          style="border: none;"
          width="800"
          height="450"
          src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FFWmoCwhZusDS1e49EWUC2KpS%2Fcircles-in-a-circle%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1"
          allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>

        <p>It's pretty cool to conceptualize what this painting could be in 3d. You could end up with different results if you approach it from different perspectives.</p>

        <p>It's also interesting to recognize that the entire sculpture can be parametrically controlled, relative to the size of the base. Through Grasshopper, you could create a file that could produce a sculpture of this of any size, and with materials of any thickness.</p>

        <div class="assignment-h2">Building the Grasshopper File</div>

        <p>I began by wiring up the base circle and a creating a single slot for the one of vertical circles that would be placed within.</p>

        <app-image-viewer
          path="../assets/images/digital-fabrication/a2/1-grasshopper.png"
          description="The main, base circle"
          class="assignment-image">
        </app-image-viewer>

        <p>Next, I added a single region difference to create a unified circle-with-slot shape.</p>

        <app-image-viewer
          path="../assets/images/digital-fabrication/a2/2-grasshopper-region-difference.png"
          description="The circle with region difference"
          class="assignment-image">
        </app-image-viewer>

        <p>
          Next, I added an additional two slots to represent more of the vertical circles. I decided to skip adding every single slot, because I was beginning to recognize the messiness of this level of nesting. I'd do the remaining ones programatically via a script if I had more time.
        </p>

          description="The circle with THREE region differences"
          class="assignment-image">
        </app-image-viewer>

        <p>
          Finally, I added the inner circles that would go within the slots -- these were computed from the original diameter, adding yet another layer of recursive messiness to my Rhino file.
        </p>

          With the Rhino file in hand, I converted to AI and laser cut the selection from two cardboard box types.
