          Hey, I'm Peter Cutler, and I'm a UX designer and developer living in Seattle.
          I'm taking Digital Fabrication to learn some cool design methods.
          I'll probably use what we learn to make things for my home, but maybe for work too.
        </p>

          Right now I'm looking forward to learning Grasshopper. Some of my friends have been using
          it on interesting projects. I'm happy to teach my peers about design, coding,
          or whatever else! Ask me anything in the Mill. Once we have to use our website for something, I'll probably update this page.
