      <p>
        I joined Crowdskout in 2015 with a directive to overhaul Crowdskout's
        data visualization system. Working with a team of engineers, I researched
        and built the foundations of the system. The system was designed
        so that a novice user could quickly learn and operate it to design and
        deliver complex visualizations without any training.

      Building a System with D3 and AmCharts
    </h2>

    <p>
      We built the system using a mix of <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://d3js.org/">
      D3</a> and a library called <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amcharts.com/">
      amCharts</a>, also built on D3. The visualization component integrated with
      the Crowdskout app as an Angular component, coded with a mix of vanilla JavaScript
      and AngularJS.

      Using a multi-step editor, a user could select an audience segment,
      criteria, and a graph type, and create a graph that could be customized or
      exported in a variety of ways.

    <p>
      Crowdskout's data visualization component is a complex, interactive module
      of the application. If you have any questions, I'm happy to walk through the
      design and code involved. Thanks for reading.
