      <p>
        In January 2018, I formed a group with three other graduate students to
        develop and conduct a usability test. We were interested in testing a
        product with a complex, novel interface &mdash; something that presented
        different questions and opportunities than traditional web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to work with VR, using the Oculus platform. We were interested
        in understanding how first-time users would grapple with this new
        interface &mdash; what hurdles they would identify during on-boarding,
        and how they would adapt and operate a software interface with no prior
        experience.
