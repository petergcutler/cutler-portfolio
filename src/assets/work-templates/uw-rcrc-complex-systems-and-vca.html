        Through a unique partnership between the <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://media.ifrc.org/">
        International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)</a>
        and the University of Washington, my class studying Complex Systems was able to collaboratively
        research ways to incorporate Human-Centered principles into the
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ifrc.org/vca">Vulnerability & Capacity Assessment (VCA)</a>
        system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The IFRC has been a leader in the development and application of participatory
        design systems, and the VCA system is just one such example. As experts on
        the meeting points of technology and human-centered research & design, we
        collaborated with many Red Cross teams to layout distinct opportunities
        to better integrate new technology into their participatory VCA approach.

      Building Understanding
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the outset of this project, our first step &mdash; and one that was foundational
      to any measurement of our success &mdash; was to recalibrate our understanding of our
      domain to align with <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/who-we-are/fundamental-principles/">
      humanitarian principles</a>.

    <p>
      Simultaneously, we dug deeply into the notion of complex systems and system
      design, reading two texts that informed our understanding.

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/streetlights-and-shadows">
          Streetlights & Shadows</a> &mdash; Gary Klein's investigation into what
          it means to design in and for a complex, changing environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00052762/">
          Information Ecology</a> &mdash; Thomas Davenport's exploration into the
          human-centered basis of the information we share.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This period of literary review and introductory interviews with our IFRC
      colleagues was critical for us to build the understanding we needed to
      in order to understand, first, the language of our clients at the IFRC, and
      in turn, the millions of individuals they support through the VCA system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some examples of the many take-aways from this period include:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        The community comes first. While there are many stakeholders in the VCA
        system, it is the community that determines the plan and owns the results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicating scope is the best way to mitigate the constant push and pull
        of changing variables in a large, complex system. Stakeholders, requirements,
        participants, and directives may constantly change, but by maintaining a
        shared sense of scope, the project can still succeed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Systems don't succeed or fail; rather, they shift around the active stakeholders'
        competing objectives. As researchers, our task is to understand the system
        and those influencing it. Once we have an understanding of the system, we
        can begin to design for it.
      </li>
    </ul>
