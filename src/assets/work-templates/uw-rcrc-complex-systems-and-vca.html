        Through a unique partnership between the <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://media.ifrc.org/">
        International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)</a>
        and the University of Washington, my class studying Complex Systems was able to collaboratively
        research ways to incorporate Human-Centered principles into the
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ifrc.org/vca">Vulnerability & Capacity Assessment (VCA)</a>
        system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The IFRC has been a leader in the development and application of participatory
        design systems, and the VCA system is just one such example. As experts on
        the meeting points of technology and human-centered research & design, we
        collaborated with many Red Cross teams to layout distinct opportunities
        to better integrate new technology into their participatory VCA approach.

      Building Understanding
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the outset of this project, our first step was to recalibrate our
      understanding of our domain to align with <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/who-we-are/fundamental-principles/">
      humanitarian principles</a> and with <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">
      Universal Human Rights</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to understand some of this task of recalibration, please take
      a look at <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wixuevlkpiu27dw/2.%20mays-racadio-gugerty.mismatch%20business%20and%20humanitarian%20logistics.2012Oct.pdf?dl=0">
      an excellent, quick summary of contextual shifts involved</a>. Designing
      with a humanitarian's outlook is not as intuitive as it sounds!

      Simultaneously, we dug deeply into the notion of complex systems and system
      design, reading two texts that informed our understanding.
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/streetlights-and-shadows">
          Streetlights & Shadows</a> &mdash; Gary Klein's investigation into what
          it means to design in and for a complex, changing environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00052762/">
          Information Ecology</a> &mdash; Thomas Davenport's exploration into the
          human-centered basis of the information we share.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This period of research aided us in understanding, first, the domain of our
      clients at the IFRC, and in turn, how they support millions of individuals
      through the VCA system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some examples of the many take-aways from this period include:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        The community comes first. While there are many stakeholders in the VCA
        system, it is the community that determines the plan and owns the results.
      </li>
      <li>
        In this domain, there are absolutely no quid pro quos. All of our actions
        are in the service of the community. Furthermore, we cannot define what
        serves the community &mdash; only they can do that.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicating scope is the best way to mitigate the constant push and pull
        of changing variables in a large, complex system. Stakeholders, requirements,
        participants, and directives may constantly change, but by maintaining a
        shared sense of scope, the project can still succeed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Systems don't succeed or fail; rather, they shift around the active
        stakeholders' competing objectives. As researchers, our first task is to
        understand the system and those influencing it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It's impossible to communicate the complexity of this system in a single case
      study, but I hope the resources above can provide some important context.
      This research period helped me to understand how to approach a complex system
      and build understanding from many different perspectives at once.

      Finding Opportunities
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our task in this class was not to design an intervention, but to plan one
      that would unfold over the ensuing year. Subsequent research groups would
      use our findings and our plan to progress from research into design. So having
      developed a nuanced understanding of the domain, our job was to outline
      research avenues that ensuing teams could explore.
