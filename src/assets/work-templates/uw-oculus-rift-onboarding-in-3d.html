      <p>
        In January 2018, I formed a group with three other graduate students to
        develop and conduct a usability test. We were interested in testing a
        product with a complex, novel interface &mdash; something that presented
        different questions and opportunities than traditional web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to work with VR, using the Oculus platform. We were interested
        in understanding how first-time users would grapple with this new
        interface &mdash; what hurdles they would identify during on-boarding,
        and how they would adapt and operate a software interface with no prior
        experience.

      VR Applications
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the outset of the project, we decided to focus on two Oculus applications:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/">
          First Contact</a> &mdash; the official on-boarding experience provided by Oculus
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1217155751659625/">
          Tilt Brush</a> &mdash; a 3d design application designed for VR
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Why these applications? First, we wanted to test an interface-driven product,
      rather than a game. I had purchased the Rift when it launched, and had seen
      how 3d design applications were taking advantage of the VR medium. As a
      team, we explored Tilt Brush together and decided it was a great candidate.
    </p>

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
      We also determined that we couldn't drop users into a complex application
      like Tilt Brush without on-boarding. As we used First Contact, we found
      we were interested in understanding users' reception and comprehension of
      the application.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the one hand, it's a very game-like experience, but on the other, it's
      responsible for imparting foundational context and direction to the user.
      We wanted to explore how the user perceived this experience, and how well
      it taught them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Heuristic Evaluation
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our professor recommended that none of our teams seek out clients to work
      with for the purposes of the class. This gave us lattitude to explore
      based on our own interests (as well as other benefits), but it meant that
      we would have to come up with a way to determine our research objectives
      independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      With no stakeholders to dictate our direction, we used a <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">
      heuristic analysis</a> of our applications to find worthwhile avenues to
      explore. Based on our evaluation, we found a wide array of possible
      problems to explore. We focused on a few out the outset:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Visibility of System Status</span>: in First Contact,
        we found there to be few indications if we were making progress. In Tilt
        Brush, we found a lack of clarity around our current tool selections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Consistency and standards</span>: input expectations
        changed from app to app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Error Prevention</span>: both applications lead the
        user toward error, often through a lack of clear direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</span>: menus and
        environments were visually noisy and sometimes overwhelming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Help and Documentation</span>: we found poor access
        to documentation within Tilt Brush.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Developing a Research Plan
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our next task was to codify our early findings into a concrete, clearly-scoped
      research plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      We prioritized problems that were foundational, rather than those that
      could be attributed to "figuring out" emerging issues in VR. At this time,
      it's unrealistic that VR apps present a common, synchronous interface, for
      instance. We focused on education and on-boarding problems, and organized
      the following research questions:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        What challenges do first-time users run into while using the Oculus
        platform?
      </li>
      <li>
        How does ease of use for each app impact satisfaction for the entire
        experience?
      </li>
      <li>
        How easily and successfully do first-time users interact with First
        Contact and Tilt Brush?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We also developed our research plan to outline how we would evaluate
      these questions.
