      <p>
        In January 2018, I began a 3-month course in Usability Testing, and formed
        a group with three others to explore user experience in VR.
        We were interestd in exploring the Oculus Touch, the motion-controllers
        that accompany the Oculus Rift. We were interested in understanding how
        users would engage with software using a novel interface for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to explore the onboarding experience through the use of two
        applications: First Contact - the platforms primary onboarding experience,
        and Tilt Brush - a 3d painting application.
