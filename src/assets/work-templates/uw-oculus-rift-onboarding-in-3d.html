      <p>
        In January 2018, I formed a group with three other graduate students to
        develop and conduct a usability test. We were interested in testing a
        product with a complex, novel interface &mdash; something that presented
        different questions and opportunities than traditional web applications.
        We decided to work with VR, using the Oculus platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were interested in understanding how first-time users would grapple
        with this new interface &mdash; what hurdles they would identify during
        on-boarding, and how they would adapt and operate a software interface
        with no prior experience.

      VR Applications
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the outset of the project, we decided to focus on two Oculus applications:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/">
          First Contact</a> &mdash; the official on-boarding experience provided by Oculus
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1217155751659625/">
          Tilt Brush</a> &mdash; a 3d design application designed for VR
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We chose these applications for a few reasons. First, we wanted to test an
      interface-driven product, rather than a game. I purchased the Rift when it
      launched, and had seen how 3d design applications were taking advantage of
      the VR medium. As a team, we explored Tilt Brush together and decided it
      was a great candidate.
    </p>

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
      We also determined that we couldn't drop users into a complex application
      like Tilt Brush without on-boarding. As we used First Contact, we found
      we were interested in understanding users' reception and comprehension of
      the application, so we included it in our tests both out of necessity and
      curiousity.

      Heuristic Evaluation
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our professor for the class, <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rebeccadestello?lang=en">
      Rebecca Destello</a>, recommended that none of our teams seek out clients
      for this class. This gave us great lattitude to explore based on our own
      interests (and many other benefits), but it meant that we would have to
      come up with a way to determine our research objectives independently. With
      no stakeholders to dictate our direction, we used a heuristic analysis of
      our applications to find worthwhile avenues to explore.
