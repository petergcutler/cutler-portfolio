      <p>
        In January 2018, I formed a group with three other graduate students to
        develop and conduct a usability test. We were interested in testing a
        product with a complex, novel interface &mdash; something that presented
        different questions and opportunities than traditional web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to work with VR, using the Oculus platform. We were interested
        in understanding how first-time users would grapple with this new
        interface &mdash; what hurdles they would identify during on-boarding,
        and how they would adapt and operate a software interface with no prior
        experience.

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      VR Applications
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the outset of the project, we decided to focus on two Oculus applications:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/">
          First Contact</a> &mdash; the official on-boarding experience provided by Oculus
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1217155751659625/">
          Tilt Brush</a> &mdash; a 3d design application designed for VR
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Why these applications? First, we wanted to test an interface-driven product,
      rather than a game. I had purchased the Rift when it launched and had seen
      how 3d design applications were taking advantage of the VR medium. As a
      team, we explored Tilt Brush together and decided it was a great candidate.
    </p>

    <div class="work-body-image-grid">
      <figure class="work-body-figure">

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
      We also determined that we couldn't drop users into a complex application
      like Tilt Brush without on-boarding. As we used First Contact, we found
      we were interested in understanding users' reception and comprehension of
      the application.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the one hand, it's a very game-like experience, but on the other, it's
      responsible for imparting foundational context and direction to the user.
      We wanted to explore how the user perceived this experience, and how well
      it taught them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Heuristic Evaluation
    </h2>

    <p>
      Without stakeholders to dictate our direction, we used a <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">
      heuristic analysis</a> of our applications to find worthwhile avenues to
      explore. Based on our evaluation, we found a wide array of possible
      problems to explore. We focused on a few at the outset:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Visibility of System Status</span>: in First Contact,
        we found some of us were confused about what we should be doing. In Tilt
        Brush, we found a lack of clarity around our current tool selections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Consistency and standards</span>: input expectations
        changed from app to app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Error Prevention</span>: both applications lead the
        user toward error, often through a lack of clear direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</span>: menus and
        environments were visually noisy and sometimes overwhelming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Help and Documentation</span>: we found poor access
        to documentation within Tilt Brush.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Research Planning
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our next task was to use our findings from discovery to develop a concrete,
      clearly-scoped research plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      We prioritized problems that were foundational, rather than those that
      could be attributed to "figuring out" emerging issues in VR. At this time,
      it's unrealistic that VR apps present a common, synchronous interface, for
      instance. We focused on education and on-boarding problems, and organized
      the following research questions:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        What challenges do first-time users run into while using the Oculus
        platform?
      </li>
      <li>
        How does ease of use for each app impact satisfaction for the entire
        experience?
      </li>
      <li>
        How easily and successfully do first-time users interact with First
        Contact and Tilt Brush?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="work-body-h3">
      Components of the Research Plan
    </h3>

    <p>
      We developed our research plan to outline how we would evaluate these
      questions. The plan included all of the necessary operational information.
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Target users, with inclusion and exclusion criteria
      </li>
      <li>
        Methodology, including moderation (in-person), duration, number of
        participants, protocols, and interview structure (e.g., pre-test
        interview, post-task interview)
      </li>
      <li>
        Task lists, including starting state and success state
      </li>
      <li>
        Data collection goals, including quantitative data, qualitative data,
        subjective/objective evaluation, and collection methodology (e.g., Think
        Aloud Protocol, or Likert scales)
      </li>
      <li>
        Test logistics, equipment, location details
      </li>
      <li>
        Results, reporting, deliverables, and timeline
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Based on our plan, we began to recruit and screen our participants. To do so
      we tapped our social networks and created an online screener survey. Meanwhile,
      we also prepared our session script, data collection documents, and
      other logistical docs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Running the Usability Study
    </h2>

    <p>
      We brought 8 individuals to Facebook's offices for our study. Each of us
      moderated two, one-hour sessions with participants.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      We each navigated many of the unique hurdles to testing in VR:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Ensuring participants were comfortable among strangers, while blind to their
        surroundings
      </li>
      <li>
        Moderating participants who can't see you
      </li>
      <li>
        Exposing participants to a completely foreign interface, and persistently
        encouraging and exploring Think-Aloud dialogue
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We also conducted the interviews outlined in our research plan -- pre and
      post-test, as well as post-task and post-application interviews. During
      our team-mates' sessions, we aided in note-taking, chaperoning
      participants with the equipment, noting quantitative success/failure, and
      asking select follow-up questions during interviews.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Analysis and Organizing Findings
    </h2>

    <p>
      We began to analyze our findings after testing our first participant. Typically,
      we would each note our own findings, and then begin to compare after reflecting
      independently. By the time we completed our eighth and final test, we had a
      growing body of findings, and were approaching consensus among the most
      severe issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      We met a number of times following the study to prioritize our findings, put
      together affinity diagrams, and draft out our presentation and report.

    <p>
      This is a detailed report, and I'd be happy to answer any questions about it.
      We uncovered many actionable findings across both First Contact and Tilt Brush.
    </p>

    <p>
      For me personally, I've enjoyed working with VR for many years, and the
      process of conducting this research only made me more certain about the
      exciting questions we can continue to explore in this interactive frontier.
