      <p>
        In January 2018, I formed a group with three other graduate students to
        develop and conduct a usability test. We were interested in testing a
        product with a complex, novel interface &mdash; something that presented
        different questions and opportunities than traditional web applications.
        We decided to work with VR, specifically, the Oculus platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were interested in understanding how first-time users would grapple
        with this new interface &mdash; what hurdles they would identify during
        on-boarding, and how they would adapt and operate the system using a
        foreign software interface.
