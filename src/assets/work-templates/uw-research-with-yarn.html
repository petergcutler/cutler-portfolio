      <p>
        Over the course of six months from 2017-2018, I worked with a Directed
        Research Group in HCDE to help run a long-term evaluation of Yarn, a
        research iOS app for writing  stories of accomplishment through personal
        data like running data, photos, videos, and text.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yarn uses a structured writing experience to help people create content
        which aligns with their goals for sharing that others would find
        interesting. Yarn was specifically designed to support two types of
        stories of personal accomplisment: training for a running race or
        working on Do-It-Yourself projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I helped to recruit, screen, and manage a cohort of 15 participants who
        used the app for 5 weeks each. Throughout the study, we conducted weekly
        surveys as well as pre- and post-study semi-structured interviews. At
        the end of the study, I helped to analyze and synthesize the data. Our
        findings are under submission to CHI Proceedings.

      At the outset of our project, the design of the Yarn application was complete,
      but the research study of its use was just beginning. I joined a team with
      three other students to help run the study and analyze our findings.
