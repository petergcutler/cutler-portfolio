      <p>
        In September 2017, I joined the University of Washington's HCDE
        program, and began my first core class: a foundational user-centered
        design course. I formed a group with three others to find a problem and
        design a user-centered solution. As we met and began to discuss the
        task, we found we were all motivated to choose a problem that was
        socially-responsible, current, under-investigated, and relevant to our
        local region.
      </p>
      <p>
        We selected a project that could resolve social, economic, and health
        hazards for thousands of Seattle's citizens: design a user-centered
        solution to help homeless Seattle residents store their possessions
        securely and sustainably.

      Opportunity Space and Scope
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the outset of the project, our opportunity space was broad: we wanted
      to look at solutions that would in some way address homelessness in
      Seattle. So our first task was to narrow our scope. To do so, we began a
      brief literature review.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seattle's effort to address homelessness is significant - so much so that
      in late 2017, it was a primary topic of the ongoing mayoral race between
      Jenny Durkan and Cary Moon. Fortunately for us, this meant that it was
      also heavily spotlighted by local media. Our literature review focused on
      the long-form investigative pieces across Seattle's shelters and tent
      cities. In the course of my review, <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s55/sh/399d9d7c-0076-4bc3-8724-f5059f4f0e54/75be081166e1709a">
      I put together many notes like this one</a>, aggregating and highlighting
      key opportunities that we could further investigate.
    </p>

    <p>
      During our lit review, we also began outreach to experts in the field. I
      wrote to <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Poppe">
      Barbara Poppe</a>, an appointee by President Obama to the U.S. Interagency
      Council on Homelessness. I began a discussion with her about our group's
      issue area and intent that helped inform our focus. She helped to
      validate and confirm our trajectory early on in the project. We also
      contacted University of Washington professors in the school of public
      health to hold informal interviews about our progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      As our group reviewed our findings and interviews, we decided to focus on
      designing sustainable storage solutions for Seattle's homeless populations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Understanding the Domain
    </h2>

    <p>
      Seattle presents many distinct populations of homeless residents who are
      relying on a variety of housing programs for support.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      These housing programs differ across the types of shelter, staff support,
      amenities, and other factors of care provided. Understanding this complex
      network of housing programs was a critical first step to designing a
      viable solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond existing housing programs, we also wanted to understand the
      financial resources that the city puts towards homelessness. We
      investigated how the budgetary resources are organized in Seattle. The
      resources here, like in many cities, are scarce. But understanding the
      financial context was critical to designing a realistic solution.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Through literature review and secondary-source interviews, we came to align
      ourselves with a budgetary concept of <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/housing/housing-first/">
      housing first</a> - the idea that the overwhelming majority of city funds
      should be put towards the creation of permanent housing solutions rather
      than stop-gap measures.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we progressed, we often asked ourselves, "is this solution worth more
      than a single permanent home?" Prioritizing "housing first," we knew our
      solution would have to use resources responsibly - either through a low
      cost or through an easy method of scaling the resources required.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Conducting a Competitive Analysis
    </h2>

    <p>
      As we researched existing solutions across the domain, we found that most
      of the designed solutions didn't account for the wide variety of housing
      programs that exist. Existing solutions also frequently employed costly
      materials or failed to align with the resource scarcity of the system.
    </p>

    </a>

    <p>
      The H.O.P.E. lockers, shown above, cost $10,000 to build. The funds were
      raised through an indiegogo campaign. Another storage pilot program in
      Denver, shown below, cost $100,000 to initiate, and included a high upkeep
      cost each month onward.
    </p>

    </a>

    <p>
      Based on the narrow scope of existing solutions, we saw an opportunity for
      a cheaper, more sustainable, community-oriented system.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Surveying Shelter Residents
    </h2>

    <p>
      In order to build an understanding of our potential design's users, we
      began planning outreach to residents of local shelters. We crafted two
      surveys - one for shelter administrators and one for shelter residents -
      to get a sense of a variety of stakeholders for a storage-oriented project.
      Some of our questions for stakeholders included:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>How long do residents leave belongings unattended?</li>
      <li>How do you ensure security?</li>
      <li>How do you manage access?</li>
      <li>How much space is available at your shelter for storage?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And for residents:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>Do you co-habitate with others?</li>
      <li>Would you be comfortable sharing storage with your group?</li>
      <li>Are you comfortable having fellow community members watch over lockers?</li>
      <li>What storage size do you require?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition to the above questions, we also asked a number of questions
      around the level of trust among the community, some methods of logistics,
      and how communication is handled between residents in different scenarios.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Visiting and Interviewing
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our group had a particular interest in Seattle's tent cities. These
      communities in particular are transitional, highly vulnerable, and were heavily
      publicized during the mayoral elections. To gain an understanding of the needs
      of residents of transitional housing, we visited Nickelsville Ballard to
      tour and interview.

    <p>
      Our guide, Jamie, provided us a tour and answered our questions in an interview.
      From our interview with Jamie, we gained a much deeper understanding of the
      relationship residents have with their belongings and storage. Some of our
      takeaways included:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Residents have significant needs for privacy, which extends to their
        storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transitional communities must be able to move on short notice due to raids
        or other relocation needs. Residents must be able to bring both their
        goods and the means to store them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jamie reiterated what our surveys found - residents have a lot of possessions,
        often over 500 or 1000 liters.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is often room for more storage, but no structure to house goods.
      </li>
    </ul>
