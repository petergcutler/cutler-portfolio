      <p>
        During the course of HCDE's User-Centered Design class, I formed a group
        with three others to find a problem and design a user-centered solution.
        As we met and discussed the task, we found we were all motivated to
        choose a problem that was socially-responsible, current,
        under-investigated, and relevant to our local region.
      </p>
      <p>
        We selected a project that could resolve social, economic, and health
        hazards for thousands of Seattle's citizens: design a user-centered
        solution to help homeless Seattle residents store their possessions
        securely and hygienically.

      Opportunity Space and Scope
    </h2>

    <p>
      After selecting our opportunity space - aiding homeless residents of
      Seattle - we spent more time identifying a specific focus. To do so, we
      began with secondary-source and literature review.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seattle's effort to address homelessness is significant. It was a primary
      discussion point during the recent mayoral race, so it was spotlighted by
      local media. Our literature review focused on the long-form investigative
      pieces across Seattle's shelters and tent cities. In the course of my
      review, <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s55/sh/399d9d7c-0076-4bc3-8724-f5059f4f0e54/75be081166e1709a">
      I put together many notes like this one</a>, aggregating and highlighting
      key opportunities that we could further investigate.
    </p>

    <p>
      We simultaneously began outreach to experts in the field. I reached out to
      <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Poppe">
      Barbara Poppe</a>, an appointee by President Obama to the U.S. Interagency
      Council on Homelessness. I began a discussion with her about our group's
      issue area and intent that helped inform our selection. She helped to
      validate and confirm our trajectory early on in the project. We also
      contacted University of Washington professors in the school of public
      health to hold informal interviews about our progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      As our group reviewed our findings and interviews, we decided to focus on
      designing sustainable storage solutions for Seattle's homeless populations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Understanding the Domain
    </h2>

    <p>
      Seattle presents many distinct populations of homeless residents who are
      relying on different types of housing programs for support.
    </p>

        class="work-body-image border"
        alt="the four types of homeless housing programs">
    </a>

    <p>
      These housing programs differ vastly across different types of shelter,
      staff support, amenities, and other factors. Understanding this complex
      network of housing programs was a critical first step to designing a viable
      solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, we investigated the budgetary resources available in Seattle.
      The resources here, like in many cities, are scarce.
    </p>

        class="work-body-image border"
        alt="the housing program budget">
    </a>

    <p>
      Through literature review and secondary-source interviews, we came to align
      ourselves with a budgetary concept of <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/housing/housing-first/">
      housing first</a> - the idea that the overwhelming majority of funds should
      be put towards the creation of permanent housing solutions rather than
      stop-gap measures.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Conducting a Competitive Analysis
    </h2>

    <p>
      As we researched existing solutions across this domain, we found that most
      of the designed solutions didn't demonstrate an adequate understanding of
      the complexity of the system. Many failed to address the wide differences
      among different types of shelters or employed costly materials that failed
      to align with the resource scarcity in the system.
    </p>

    <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/upvwaf91xdx7d9y/hope-lockers.jpg?dl=0">

        class="work-body-image border"
        alt="HOPE Lockers">
    </a>

    <p>
      The H.O.P.E. lockers, shown above, cost $10,000 to build. The funds were
      raised through an indiegogo campaign. Another storage pilot program in
      Denver, shown below, cost $100,000 to initiate, and included a high upkeep
      cost each month onward.
    </p>

        class="work-body-image border"
        alt="Denver Storage Lockers">
    </a>

    <p>
      Based on the narrow scope of existing solutions, we saw an opportunity for
      a cheaper, more sustainable, community-oriented system.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Surveying Shelter Residents
    </h2>

    <p>
      In order to build an understanding of our potential design's users, we
      began planning outreach to residents of local shelters. We crafted two
      surveys - one for shelter administrators and one for shelter residents -
      to get a sense of a variety of stakeholders for a storage-oriented project.
      Some of our questions for stakeholders included:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>How long do residents leave belongings unattended?</li>
      <li>How do you ensure security?</li>
      <li>How do you manage access?</li>
      <li>How much space is available at your shelter for storage?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And for residents:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>Do you co-habitate with others?</li>
      <li>Would you be comfortable sharing storage with your group?</li>
      <li>Are you comfortable having fellow community members watch over lockers?</li>
      <li>What storage size do you require?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition to the above questions, we also asked a number of questions
      around the level of trust among the community, some methods of logistics,
      and how communication is handled between residents in different scenarios.
    </p>

    <h2 class="work-body-h2">
      Visiting and Interviewing
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our group had a particular interest in Seattle's tent cities. These
      communities in particular are transitional, highly vulnerable, and were heavily
      publicized during the mayoral elections. To gain an understanding of the needs
      of residents of transitional housing, we visited Nickelsville Ballard to
      tour and interview.

    <p>
      Our guide, Jamie, provided us a tour and answered our questions in an interview.
      From our interview with Jamie, we gained a much deeper understanding of the
      relationship residents have with their belongings and storage. Some of our
      key takeaways included:
    </p>

    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Residents have significant needs for privacy, which extends to their
        storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transitional communities must be able to move on short notice due to raids
        or other relocation needs. They must be able to bring both their goods and
        the means to store them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jamie reiterated what our surveys found - residents have a lot of possessions,
        often over 500 or 1000 liters.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is often room for more storage, but no structure to house goods.
      </li>
    </ul>
